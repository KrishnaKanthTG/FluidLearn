    "FluidLearn is a software package with python interface, capable of solving non-linear fluid flow problems using supervised deep learning techniques. The solution function is approximated as a neural network, which will be trained using labelled data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, this API could be used to solve any well-posed PDE system, given enough labelled data in the form of boundary and initial conditions. The architecture could also be used for physical parameter estimation and surrogate modelling. As of now, the package is oriented towards PDE systems governing fluid flow problems with many popular flow systems inbuilt.  Users have the option to train the model from external data, visualize the training curves, save the model, reload the model, continue training the saved model or make predictions from the saved models.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The package could be seen as an application of the [Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10561) which are artificial neural nets training with PDE constraints. The idea was first introduced in [this publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.10561.pdf) in 2017. For more details on the mathematical theory behind PINNs, please visit the website maintained by the author of the aforementioned publication [here](https://maziarraissi.github.io/PINNs/).  \n",

    "The FluidLearn api is built on top of tensorflow with keras model subclassing. Most of the  details are hidden from the end user, who will be dealing only with the fluidlearn package interface. For developers, with knowledge of keras and tensor flow APIs, who would like more control over the package or would like to add more features could do so easily by inspecting the modulular structure of the package. For all users, except developers, installation of the package from python's official [PyPi distribution](https://pypi.org/project/fluidlearn/) or pip is recommended. The latter users could use the code directly from [here](https://github.com/mjayadharan/FluidLearn/tree/master/fluidlearn) after setting up dependencies.  \n",
    "While the users will find no problem accessing the package through a regular python script, just like with any other machine learning library, it will be visually advantageous to use a notebook setting like jupyter notebook. For this reason, all the demo examples are available in both python(.py) and jupyter notebook (.ipynb) formats."
